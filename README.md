Miniproject for programming of complex software system

For this project we have created a online version of a dice game.

The rules are:

each player has 4 dice

first player gives an estimate of how many of a certain kind he thinks there is.

If the second player does not believe the previous player he can lift and a looser will be decided.

Second player then has two options, if the player believe player1 is correct he must then increase the "bet" either by raising the amount of dice or increasing the amount on the dice.

The game then continous untill someone lifts.
